  占用: "Space used",
  上一个位置还留着东西: "Still in the previous location",

    "These are still in {dir}: {names}. A move left them behind, so a wallpaper, a theme pack or the backups an update rolls back to can look gone on this machine. Copying those folders into the current location restores them.",

    "Moves {size} in {n} files; the destination has {free} free. Takes effect after a restart.",
  "这个文件夹里已经存着这块数据（{size}，{n} 个文件）。直接指过去就行，不复制、也不删。重启后生效。":
    "This folder already holds that data ({size} in {n} files). It will simply be pointed at — nothing is copied and nothing is deleted. Takes effect after a restart.",

    "Transcripts, compaction archives, usage stats, rewind snapshots",
  索引与缓存: "Indexes and caches",
  "搜索索引与派生数据，删掉会自动重建":
    "Search indexes and derived data; deleting them rebuilds them",

    "How instances exclude each other; these must stay in one place on this machine. Each is an empty file and removing one would break the exclusion, so they are kept rather than cleaned",
